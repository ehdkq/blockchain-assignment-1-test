# blockchain assignment 1

I recreated the project in Visual Studio 2022 on Windows.

I had some trouble running the program initially becasue it threw an error saying it was lacking a starter function, which was fixed with changing the "main" in the program to the "starter" word, and it worked properly. I was able to run the program normally using the command "node blockchain.js" in the command line in Ubuntu Linux using VMware as my virtual machine host.

----Short Reflection----

I had somewhat of a hard time doing this assignment, not with the actual code itself, but with setting up Linux and the programs and commands along with it. I tried committing the project through Linux since I had the project already there, but it wasn't wanting to work and I didn't want to use outside software to force it, since it wasn't working. I'm not sure if it was a compatibility issue or if it was just sheer ignorance with my low experience using Linux.

Hashing and immutability is important just in general, but especially in blockchain. Hashing helps chain everything together, which is helpful in finding what came before a certain hash as well as it's own part of it's own hash, which is very helpful in areas like cyrptography and blockchain specifically. Immutability is important as well, because you wouldn't want anything to be changed in the future. If you have a block and one part of it changes, it can alter the entire chain and make it fall apart or perhaps lose data.

Proof of work requires people in the network to solve puzzles to add a new block to the blockchain, aka mining. It prevents double spending, so only one valid block can be added at a time, so there's no mixup. It makes attacks unfeasible, since the malicious party would have to remine a whole block to do anything, and it takes too much processing time to do that.

I had some surprises while helping to fix the code for this assignment. I was mostly scared about looking at javascript since I have no experience in it, but it wasn't horrible. The syntax is something I'm not familiar with, but I was able to read it decently well. It was also odd to me that it required a starter function instead of a main function, but that could've been something very specific for this particular program or just simply running it in command line. It was nice using a different version of Linux, since I had to use Kali Linux for a previous course. It is still similar but there are some small differences.
